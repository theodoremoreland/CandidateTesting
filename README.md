# Candidate Testing

A trivia quiz written in node.js for the purpose of demonstrating and exercising competency in fundamental programming concepts such as functions, for loops, arrays, indexing, string formatting, and more. 

The quiz uses the .txt files "questions.txt" and "answers.txt" for the questions and correct answers. Questions and answers are separated by linebreaks in the .txt file and are grouped by the line their respective text is saved (i.e. line #7 in "answers.txt" is assumed to be the answer for the question on line #7 in "questions.txt").
